**Roller_Coaster** (roco) is a Python tool designed for comprehensive heterozygosity analysis and identification of runs of homozygosity (ROH) in diploid genomes. The tool employs a sliding window approach on base-pair resolution BCF files, providing detailed insights into genomic homozygosity patterns that can reveal population history, inbreeding levels, and selection signatures.
